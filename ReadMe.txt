## Readme

HTML HEAD:
	1. Change the keywords on line 7.
	2. Change the description on line 8, 12 and 19 to be the same piece of text.
	3. If you even want to change the title, that is done on line 11, 13, 16, 20 and 24.
	4. When the site is hosted, change the url on line 14 to be the url of the hosted site.
	5. If you even need to change the fonts, that is done on line 25 in the HTML, then on line 5 and 9 in the CSS.
	6. [Optional] When you have finished changing the background image, take a screenshot of the landing page and add it to the imaged folder and give it a simple name. then use the new image on line 15, 17 and 21 in the format "images/example.jpg"
	7. [Optional] An icon should be included on line 23. Currently it is commented out, but this should be a .png version of a logo (if you have one) This part is optional, but highly recommended.

HTML BODY:
	8. If the main background image needs to be changed, it needs to be uploaded to the images folder and given a simple name. then in the CSS on line 33, change the link to the new image name.
	9. The image on line 49 is where a profile image etc goes. It is set to a width of 250px, and the height will stay the same. So the image will distort if it is a weird resolution.
	10. Also on the image on line 49, change the description in the alt="" tag to be a small description of the image.
	11. Add text inside <p class="hidden"></p> tags. If the hidden class is not included, then the fade in animation wont run. This is included for the about me section, and the my work section.
	12. If you need to change the email or phone number, make sure to change the text both inside the href="" tag and the normal text inside the <a></a> tags.
